This is a stand alone PyQGIS application. It's not meant to be a "real" app but is currently in good running condition. I wrote it using PyQGIS (Qt 5). 
My main intention for uploading this is that perhaps somebody can benefit from this by way of learning how to write  special stand alone apps with PyQgis/PyQt.
Kindly read the latest QGIS programming cookbook. The code here will also shed light on how to develop python scripts and plugin in QGIS. If anybody would
like to learn, I can create a documentation on how I wrote this and I can also write how to create scripts and plugins that works (Qt5 and Qt6).
